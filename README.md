# tango_robot
Demo of robot control through augmented reality app using Google Tango device.

This repo has only 3 scripts for Unity. All the Unity prefabs and other necessary objects are part of google tango unity sdk and examples provided with it. To be able to recreate this demo, it is necessary to load AreaLearning demo provided with the sdk, and swap the scripts. Of course, you'll also need your own robot to actually run the demo.
